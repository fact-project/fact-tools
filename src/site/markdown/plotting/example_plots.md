Plotting Processes
=================

While the fact tools are not supposed to replace any existing framework for plotting data points, it still provides some simple 
plotting functionality to get a quick overview of the data you're currently working on. Plotters can be used just like any other 
processor in the *fact-tools*. Simply add the line to your .xml and the plotter will be called.
Processors providing plotting features will be located in the fact.plotter package.
