FACT Tools
----------

The fact-tools are a set of Java classes that provide an extension
to the <a href="http://www.jwall.org/streams">streams</a> framework
enabling it to read and process data from the FACT telescope. The
objective of this project is to provide scalable preprocessing for the
analysis chain of FACT data.

The [FACT (First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope)](https://www.fact-project.org/) Telescope is located on the
Island of La Palma at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos. It was put into operation in 2011 
and has been watching various gamma ray sources since then.  

####GUI
One of the central components of the *fact-tools* is the [FACT viewer](viewer.html) application. This tool provides a simple
interactive visualization component for FACT data.

####Programming
For a quick overview for creating your own custom processors see the [Programming Section](programming_examples/programming_example.html)


####Downloading
