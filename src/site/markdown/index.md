FACT Tools
----------

The fact-tools are a set of Java classes that provide an extension
to the <a href="http://www.jwall.org/streams">streams</a> framework
enabling it to read and process data from the FACT telescope. The
objective of this project is to provide scalable preprocessing for the
analysis chain of FACT data.

One of the central components of the *fact-tools* is the [FACT viewer]{viewer.html} application. This tool provides a simple
interactive visualization component for FACT data.
