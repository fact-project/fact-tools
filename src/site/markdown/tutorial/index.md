# FACT Tools Tutorial

This tutorial provides an introduction to the FACT tools for the preprocessing
of telescope data. The FACT tools cover the processing steps from raw camera-level
to the image cleaning and extraction of image parameters (Hillas parameters).



### Software Requirements

The FACT Tools are written in Java, which allows their execution on any system
with a Java virtual machine. The binary jar file is self-contained and does not
require any pre-installation.

The following list shows the requirements for the tutorial hands-on session:

  1. A recent Java Runtime environment (Java 1.7 or higher). OpenJDK is working
     fine and can easily be installed on CentOS/Ubuntu machines using the
     package management.

  2. The [latest FACT-Tools binary](http://sfb876.tu-dortmund.de/FACT/fact-tools_latest.jar) file.



### Supplementary Material

We will here publish the example configuration files and slides for the tutorial
during the CTA School in Sesto/Sexten.
