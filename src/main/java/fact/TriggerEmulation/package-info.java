 * This package contains classes and processors to emulate the hardware trigger 
 * and trigger logic of FACT.
 * 
 * Sources for the physics background:
 * [S1] Design and operation of FACT - the first G-APD Cherenkov telescope
 *      (DOI: 10.1088/1748-0221/8/06/P06008)
 * [S2] P.Voglers PhD thesis (DOI: 10.3929/ETHZ-A-010568419)
 *
 * It supports the following features of the real hardware trigger:
 *
 * - Discrimator (digitization of the analog signals in a patch, by testing if
 *                the signal amplitude is above a given threshold for a given 
 *               time over threshold of 4ns according to [S2])
 * - Conversion from DAC (12 bit, 2.5V full range[S2]) to millivolt forth and back 
 * - Trigger Logic emulation
 *   - N-out-of-4 logic (by counting how many patches per FTU have a signal 
 *     above threshold)
 *   - N-out-of-40 logic (by counting how many FTUs responded to have triggered)
 *   - simple trigger coincidence for n == 1 in a n-out-of-4 and a n-out-of-40 
 *     logic (by determining on a sorted list of trigger slices, n-out-of-40
 *     have a trigger with the duration of a given time window)
 * - Ratescans (scanning the trigger thresholds of the patches)
 *
 * The following features are known to be NOT YET implemented:
 *
 * - Coincidence of trigger signals of a n-out-of-4 and a n-out-of-40 logic 
 *   for n > 1 (It is not clear how this is realized in the hardware)
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link fact.TriggerEmulation.Discriminator} is a class with functions to
 * discriminate the signal of a given patch (or a bunch of them). Furthermore it contains helper funtions
 * for the discrimination e.g. conversion between DAC and mV.
 * <li>{@link fact.TriggerEmulation.EmulateDiscriminator} is a processor that emulates
 * a discriminator that is working on the summed timeseries of patches. It uses functions from {@link fact.TriggerEmulation.Discriminator}
 * <li>{@link fact.TriggerEmulation.EmulateLogic} is a processor that emulates th n-out-of-4 trigger logic of FACT's
 * trigger unit and the n-out-of-40 logic of the trigger master by applying it to the array of trigger primitives compiled
 * by {@link fact.TriggerEmulation.EmulateDiscriminator}
 * <li>{@link fact.TriggerEmulation.Ratescan} is a processor that performs a software ratescan on summed patch time series
 * by iterating over a list of thresholds and applying {@link fact.TriggerEmulation.Discriminator} to the data
 * <li>{@link fact.TriggerEmulation.findMaximumTriggerThreshold}  is a processor that Scan the TriggerThreshold for each
 *  event in order to find the maximum possible threshold to keep the event by applying
 *  {@link fact.TriggerEmulation.Discriminator}.
 * <li>{@link fact.TriggerEmulation.SumUpPatches} lets you sum up the signals of each patch element wise and
 * returns an array of patchwise timeseries;
