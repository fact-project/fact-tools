 * This package contains classes and processors to emulate the hardware trigger and trigger logic of FACT.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link fact.TriggerEmulation.Discriminator} is a class with functions to
 * discriminate the signal of a given patch (or a bunch of them). Furthermore it contains helper funtions
 * for the discrimination e.g. conversion between DAC and mV.
 * <li>{@link fact.TriggerEmulation.EmulateDiscriminator} is a processor that emulates
 * a discriminator that is working on the summed timeseries of patches. It uses functions from {@link fact.TriggerEmulation.Discriminator}
 * <li>{@link fact.TriggerEmulation.EmulateLogic} is a processor that emulates th n-out-of-4 trigger logic of FACT's
 * trigger unit and the n-out-of-40 logic of the trigger master by applying it to the array of trigger primitives compiled
 * by {@link fact.TriggerEmulation.EmulateDiscriminator}
 * <li>{@link fact.TriggerEmulation.Ratescan} is a processor that performs a software ratescan on summed patch time series
 * by iterating over a list of thresholds and applying {@link fact.TriggerEmulation.Discriminator} to the data
 * <li>{@link fact.TriggerEmulation.findMaximumTriggerThreshold}  is a processor that Scan the TriggerThreshold for each
 *  event in order to find the maximum possible threshold to keep the event by applying
 *  {@link fact.TriggerEmulation.Discriminator}.
 * <li>{@link fact.TriggerEmulation.SumUpPatches} lets you sum up the signals of each patch element wise and
 * returns an array of patchwise timeseries;
 * </ul>
