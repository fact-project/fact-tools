* The **Fact-Tools** are supposed to be a modular Analysis Framework for the **FACT Telescope**. 
* It is build upon the **streams**-framework which allows to define the control- and dataflow of the program via .xml files.
* To quote the official [Website](http://www.jwall.org/streams/ "Website vonne streams. Lecker")
* 
*  > The streams framework is a Java implementation of a simple stream processing environment. It aims at providing a clean and easy-to-use Java-based platform to process streaming data.
*  > The core module of the streams library is a thin API layer of interfaces and classes that reflect a high-level view of streaming processes. 
*  > This API serves as a basis for implementing custom processors and providing services with the streams library.
