* Classes in this package should implement the Overlay interface. Overlays are shapes which can be drawn on the camera map to 
* visualize different parameters of the event. Like the ellipse or the position of the source in the camera. Also useful is the 
* PixelSet overlay which simply highlights a set of pixel.  This is useful to visualize showers for example.
