This processor calculates the photon charge by the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the {\ttfamily MaxAmplitude} processor to find the maximum
  value in the slices ({\em maxAmplitude}).
\item In the area between {\em amplitudePosition} and {\em
    amplitudePosition} - 25, search for the position having 0.5 times
  the original {\em maxAmplitude} value. This reveals a slice index
  {\em halfMaxPos}.
\item Sum up all slices between {\em halfMaxPos} and {\em halfMaxPos +
    30}.
\item Divide the sum by the {\em integralGain} and store the result.
\end{enumerate}
Treatment of edge cases is currently very arbitrarily affected, since
pixels with these values should not be considered {\em shower pixels}
anyways.
