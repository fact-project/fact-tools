This processor implements a simple Fir filter. See \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir\_filter}
for details. The coefficients of the ? are stored in an array $[n, n-1, n-2,\ldots]$.

The {\ttfamily template} parameter can be used for fine-tuning the filter. Possible values 
for {\ttfamily template} are: $n_{3-average}, n_{5-average}, removeSignal, cfd$. $n_3$ and $n_5$
average are simply windowed averages. $cfd$ is also known as {\em Constant Fraction Discriminator}, 
which uses
\begin{displaymath}
   [-0.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1].
\end{displaymath}
