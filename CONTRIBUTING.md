## Versioning Scheme

Starting with version 0.6.5 we all solemly swear to abide to the following versioning scheme. All who fail to follow these rules will be forced
to buy a round of alcoholic beverages for everyone else.

* The master branch only contains stable versions and no SNAPSHOTS (stable in this case mean we are comfortable with publishing results and sharing the program with other people)
* Version numbers have to look like this:  0.X.YZ(-SNAPSHOT). Where X,Y,Z are natural numbers.
* An xml file written for version 0.X has to work for all versions 0.X.YZ
* Major version changes i.e from 0.X to 0.Z will be tagged for release
* For new experimental features use a feature branch. See [this tutorial](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) for more information.

## Unit Tests

You will receive weekly hugs and much respect from your fellow peers for writing unit tests and documentation. 
Especially for adding content to our ever growing [project website](http://sfb876.tu-dortmund.de/FACT/) by editing
the content under the src/site directory.
